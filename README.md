# rotation
This Command-Line application rotates a word-list according to a user specified Caesar Cipher rotation, then compares the rotated list against the source list to search for any matching entries.

A sample word-list can be downloaded from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt?raw=true
Alternative word-lists work just as well, as long as each word in the list is separated by a newline.
Otherwise, simple modifications to the code I have provided can allow you to use other delimiters, such as commas, tabs, etc.

The flowchart for this application will be created and uploaded shortly.
This code solves a simple problem with a simple algorithm, there's no real need to protect it with any special licensing. Feel free to copy or modify. If you're a nice guy, leave my name in the project and include a link to this repository.
